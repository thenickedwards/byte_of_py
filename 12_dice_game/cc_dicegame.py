Your Challenge:
Write the content of the body for the dicegame() function so that it works like this:
When the code is first run, this menu is shown:
    Current High Score: 0
    1) Roll Dice
    2) Leave Game
    Enter your choice:

Entering a choice of 1 results in a pair of dice being "thrown". That is, two separate random integers from 1-6 are chosen. 
The result from each "roll" is shown to the player, along with the total. 
The total is also compared to the value of high_score. If it is higher than the high_score, then it is set as the new high score, and a message is shown.
    Current High Score: 0
    1) Roll Dice
    2) Leave Game
    Enter your choice: 1
    
    You roll a... 2
    You roll a... 6
    
    You have rolled a total of: 8
    
    New high score!
    
    Current High Score: 8
    1) Roll Dice
    2) Leave Game
    Enter your choice: 2
    
    Goodbye!
    
The player can repeat option 1 as many times as they like. If they choose option 2, the game exits:

TIPS:
Use an infinite while loop, breaking out of the loop if the player chooses option "2". 
To include newlines in your print statements, you can use \n inside quotes. For example, the \n in this print statement creates a newline at the end of the text:
print("New high score!\n")
You will need to use what you learned about modifying global variables in local scope.
