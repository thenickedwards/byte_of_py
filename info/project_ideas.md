# Brainstorming Portfolio Project - NE

Rolling around a few ideas for the game project in my head and what may be possible to meet the requirements within the timeframe. Here's what I got:

- **Password Helper** <br>
  This isn't so much a game as a tool but could assist with suggesting strong passwords for a user. The idea being the user could submit a word or short phrase and the application would convert a few of the characters to create a "root" password and then also suggest (or use user input) to add characters specific to the login around the root of the password.

- **Wordle Aid:** <br>
  This application could take in a user's Wordle guess and offer possible solutions for the next guess. Upper case letters could be used to denote correct letters in the correct place, lower case letters for correct letters in the wrong place, and underscores for unknown letters in the solution. The user would also need to submit "spent" letters that are incorrect to provide the next best guess for the answer.

- **Dots & Boxes:** <br>
  Not sure how this could be represented without a FE or GUI but the game board is a series of dots laid out in a grid. The user and the program would take turns drawing a line between two adjacent dots. If they complete a square, they make their initial in the square to claim it and draw another line until all boxes are drawn.
