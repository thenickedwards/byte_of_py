		<p> 
If you wish to compete for the Graduate with Honors, here is the checklist: <br>   
**THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT, NOT A TEAM EFFORT. <br>
 Because this project could be a project that you showcase to your next employer and/or client. <br> 

<div><strong>PUBLISHING</strong></div><br>  
-Publish your personal portfolio project code on Github<br>   
-Look at the end of the React Native course or NodeJS course that you just completed. <br>
-Place this video in the graduation Front End (react native), Full Stack(nodejs), Back End(devops) graduation project folders that applies to the month of your graduation ceremony (may not be the same month that you complete your bootcamp).  <br>
-Use your latest email that you used within Nucamp registration.  <br>
-Within your folder, name the project with your First Name and Last Name <br>
<br>

<div><strong>VIDEO</strong><div>  <br>
-Produce a video of your portfolio project which lasts 5 minutes or less.<br>    
-The video is typically a screen-share which must include your voice-over   <br>
-Present only ONE project from React, React Native or Node (not bootstrap)  <br>
-The video is a demo of the site / app  <br>
-Show the features of your website or app  <br>
-Explain 1 or 2 challenges, and how they were overcome   <br>
-Showcase your code in Visual Studio as part of your video  <br>
-Make sure your voice recording is professional, eligible, and audible  <br>
-Use mp4 format  <br>
-DO NOT SUBMIT A UDEMY PROJECT AS YOUR OWN.<br>
<br>

<div><strong>BEST PRACTICES</strong><div>  <br>
-Check out the Nucamp Coding Bootcamp Youtube Student projects channel,<br>
for examples: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRL-N7m2cRDOjjedo42d7zRnlwh-RF7La <br> 
-Announce your name at the beginning of the video: Example: “This is Michael Bird cont'd<br>
My Graduate with Honors project is a React Native app that helps sports fans monitor basketball stats.”  <br>
-Provide background of the project, the libraries used, any extra tools used<br>
<br>

<div><strong>SHOWCASE THE PROJECT</strong><div> <br>
-Discuss challenge(s) at the end: Example: “The biggest challenge in this course was incorporating Redux.<br>
After much experimentation and reading documentation, I was able to implement it by… "" <br>
-Showcase at the end, including a review of what you like most about your code.   <br>
-Closing: Example: “Thank you for viewing my project. My future project is…” <br>
<br>

<div><strong>CLOSING</strong> <br>
We may select a few projects to be showcased on our web site, so please indicate <br>
if you agree or not to have the video and the Github link published online.
