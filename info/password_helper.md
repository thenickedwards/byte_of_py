# Password Helper Brainstorm

## Introduction to Method

The program should begin by laying out for the user how the application can help the user create a dynamic and memorbale system that will create a unique password for each login.

The primary portion that the user must contribute are two components: 1. alphabetic string and 2. a few numbers. The user will be coached to make these selections with the idea being they will be easy for the user to remember but difficult for another person to guess.

The alpha string and numbers will then be put through a random number of letter or number replacements. This will for the "base" or "root" of the password that will then have prefixes and/or suffixes added to the base password (this will also be at the user's discretion for easy of remembering).
