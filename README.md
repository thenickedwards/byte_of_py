# byte_of_py

A Pythonic playground for practicing purposeful programming, polishing problem-solving, and pushing personal progress.

## 01 - The README - What's all this then?

This is a repo where I have commited to pracitcing writing Python code and algorithims. Many of the directories are self-explanatory, though I will there is a table of contents below with more details.

### 02 Hello World

### 03 Conditionals - if, while

### 04 Conditionals - chained, nested

### 05 Game Script - Battle Game v0

A DnD-like text game that accepts user input and mimics TTRPG combat.

### 06 Algorithm Practice

expressions, scripting, comparison, data types, etc

### 07 Game Script - Battle Game v1
